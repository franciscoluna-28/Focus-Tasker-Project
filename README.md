# Focus-Tasker-Project

## Installing and setting up the libraries:
To install successfully libraries in C++, you'd need to follow the following steps:
- Step 1) Clone the repository using 'git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git' in a new folder inside 'C:' or the corresponding disk drive, preferably named 'dev'.
- Step 2) Once the repository has been cloned, navigate to it using the command 'cd vcpkg'.
- Step 3) Run 'bootstrap-vcpkg.bat'. This will install VCPKG on our operating system.
- Step 4) Run 'vcpkg integrate install'.
- Step 5) Run 'vcpkg install libharu'. This will install the required libharu library for the project using VCPKG.

## Using our project
To get started with our project, follow these steps:
- Step 1) Download the provided .zip file in this repository

- Step 2) Extract it into a new folder
- Step 3) Open it with Visual Studio or your favorite IDE
- Step 4) Set up the development environment by following the instructions below

## Setting up the Development Environment 
It is crucial to set up the development environment correctly in order to use installed libraries in C++ to guarantee that the project runs without a hitch. The environment can be prepared as follows:
- Step 1) Open the Solution Explorer.
- Setp 2) Select the corresponding solution.
- Step 3) Go to "VC++ Directories" under configuration properties.
- Step 4) Add the header file path under "Include Directories"
- Step 5) Add the library file path under "Library Directories"
- Step 6) Include the necessary library with '#include <library_name.h>'

## What is Focus Tasker?
Focus Tasker is a task manager designed for students at Bicentenaria de Aragua University. The platform allows students to select their major, semester, and specialty, and plan their upcoming tasks in a PDF format. In addition, Focus Tasker includes Pomodoro and Guess-the-Number functionalities to help students stay focused and engaged.

Our application is based on the functionalities of Notion, which allows for PDF conversion, and Taskade, which provides the ability to add tasks to the platform. Stay organized, play, and stay focused with Focus Tasker, made on the C++ console only!

# What we learned in this project
- How to use Visual Studio for C++ development, which helped us implement modern C++ coding standards more easily than Dev-C++.
- The fundamentals of functional programming, including how to use pointers effectively.
- How to use VCPKG to manage library dependencies for our project.
- Working collaboratively as a team of three, each member contributed their unique skills to create something special.
- The importance of the refactoring stage, which helped us create sub-functions and reduce the amount of code used in our program.
- The significance of commenting and documenting our code to help others understand our thought process and implementation.
- How to use headers in C++ and why they are essential for modularity.
- How to use <vector> and nested arrays in real-world programming.
- Collaborating effectively using Notion to manage tasks and plan our project.
